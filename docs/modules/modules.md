With the advent of [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html), we are creating a centralised repository of modules.
These are software tool process definitions that can be imported into any pipeline.
This allows multiple pipelines to use the same code for share tools and gives a greater degree of granulairy and unit testing.

The nf-core DSL2 modules repository is at <https://github.com/nf-core/modules>

### Custom remote modules

The modules supercommand comes with two flags for specifying a custom remote:

- `--git-remote <git remote url>`: Specify the repository from which the modules should be fetched as a git URL. Defaults to the github repository of `nf-core/modules`.
- `--branch <branch name>`: Specify the branch from which the modules should be fetched. Defaults to the default branch of your repository.

For example, if you want to install the `fastqc` module from the repository `nf-core/modules-test` hosted at `gitlab.com`, you can use the following command:

```terminal
nf-core modules --git-remote git@gitlab.com:nf-core/modules-test.git install fastqc
```

Note that a custom remote must follow a similar directory structure to that of `nf-core/module≈õ` for the `nf-core modules` commands to work properly.

The directory where modules are installed will be prompted or obtained from `org_path` in the `.nf-core.yml` file if available. If your modules are located at `modules/my-folder/TOOL/SUBTOOL` your `.nf-core.yml` should have:

```yaml
org_path: my-folder
```

Please avoid installing the same tools from two different remotes, as this can lead to further errors.

The modules commands will during initalisation try to pull changes from the remote repositories. If you want to disable this, for example
due to performance reason or if you want to run the commands offline, you can use the flag `--no-pull`. Note however that the commands will
still need to clone repositories that have previously not been used.

### Private remote repositories

You can use the modules command with private remote repositories. Make sure that your local `git` is correctly configured with your private remote
and then specify the remote the same way you would do with a public remote repository.
