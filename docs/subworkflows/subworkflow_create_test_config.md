All subworkflows on [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) have a strict requirement of being unit tested using minimal test data.
To help developers build new subworkflows, the `nf-core subworkflows create-test-yml` command automates the creation of the yaml file required to document the output file `md5sum` and other information generated by the testing.
After you have written a minimal Nextflow script to test your subworkflow in `/tests/subworkflow/<subworkflow_name>/main.nf`, this command will run the tests for you and create the `/tests/subworkflow/<tool>/<subtool>/test.yml` file.
